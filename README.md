# **BloodConnect: AI-Powered Blood Donation Platform**

## **Core Idea**

**BloodConnect is an app where you can have voice conversations with virtual AI patients who need blood donations.**

### **How It Works**

#### **Virtual Patients, Real Conversations**
- The app shows you profiles of **AI-generated patients** (not real people)
- Each AI patient has a unique personality, voice, and story
- You can **talk to them** like you're having a phone conversation
- They tell you their story, answer your questions, and thank you personally

#### **Powered by Advanced AI Voice Technology**
- Uses **ElevenLabs v3** for incredibly realistic, emotional speech
- The AI patients sound completely human - with emotions, pauses, and natural conversation
- Each conversation feels personal and authentic

#### **The Goal: Emotional Connection = Action**
- After talking to an AI patient, you feel emotionally connected to them
- This emotional bond motivates you to actually donate blood
- The app then helps you book a real donation appointment

### **Why This Works**

**People donate more when they feel personally connected to someone who needs help.**

Instead of seeing a generic message like "Blood needed," you have a heartfelt conversation with "Sarah" who tells you about her family and how your donation will help her get better.

### **The Innovation**

**It's not about real patients - it's about creating real emotions through AI conversations that inspire real-world blood donations.**

The AI patients feel authentic enough to create genuine empathy, leading to more people actually donating blood to help real patients in hospitals.

### **Simple Formula**
```
Virtual Connection → Real Emotion → Real Donation
```

## **Technical Stack**

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
