# BloodConnect UI Development TODO

This document outlines the UI development tasks for the BloodConnect application prototype. The focus is on creating the user interface screens for AI-powered virtual patient conversations that inspire real blood donations.

**Core Concept:** Virtual AI patients with realistic voices (ElevenLabs v3) have personal conversations with donors to create emotional connections that motivate real-world blood donations.

**Design Inspiration:** Following **Globos Voice-First Social Media Application** design principles - ultra-minimalist, clean, voice-first interface with large circular profiles and tiny status indicators.

**MOBILE-ONLY DESIGN:** This application supports **mobile view only** with a maximum width of **480px**. No desktop or tablet responsive design required - the screen will not expand beyond mobile dimensions.

**UI LIBRARY:** Uses **shadcn/ui exclusively** - no custom UI components or other UI libraries allowed. All components must use shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS styling.
